    "# Differential Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "Like $k$-Anonymity, *differential privacy* is a formal notion of privacy. Unlike $k$-Anonymity, however, differential privacy is a property of *algorithms*, and not a property of *data*. That is, we can prove that an *algorithm* satisfies differential privacy; to show that a *dataset* satisfies differential privacy, we must show that the algorithm which produced it satisfies differential privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function which satisfies differential privacy is often called a *mechanism*. We say that a *mechanism* $F$ satisfies differential privacy if for all *neighboring datasets* $x$ and $x'$, and all possible outputs $S$,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\frac{\\mathsf{Pr}[F(x) = S]}{\\mathsf{Pr}[F(x') = S]} \\leq e^\\epsilon\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Two datasets are considered neighbors if they differ in the data of a single individual. Note that $F$ is typically a *randomized* function, so that the probability distribution describing its outputs is not just a point distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important implication of this definition is that $F$'s output will be pretty much the same, *with or without* the data of any specific individual. In other words, the randomness built into $F$ should be \"enough\" so that an observed output from $F$ will not reveal which of $x$ or $x'$ was the input. Imagine that my data is present in $x$ but not in $x'$. If an adversary can't determine which of $x$ or $x'$ was the input to $F$, then the adversary can't tell whether or not my data was *present* in the input - let alone the contents of that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\epsilon$ parameter in the definition is called the *privacy parameter* or the *privacy budget*. $\\epsilon$ provides a knob to tune the \"amount of privacy\" the definition provides. Small values of $\\epsilon$ require $F$ to provide *very* similar outputs when given similar inputs, and therefore provide higher levels of privacy; large values of $\\epsilon$ allow less similarity in the outputs, and therefore provide less privacy. \n",
    "\n",
    "How should we set $\\epsilon$ to prevent bad outcomes in practice? Nobody knows. The general consensus is that $\\epsilon$ should be around 1 or smaller, and values of $\\epsilon$ above 10 probably don't do much to protect privacy - but this rule of thumb could turn out to be very conservative.

    "The easiest way to achieve differential privacy for this query is to add random noise to its answer. The key challenge is to add enough noise to satisfy the definition of differential privacy, but not so much that the answer becomes too noisy to be useful. To make this process easier, some basic *mechanisms* have been developed in the field of differential privacy, which describe exactly what kind of - and how much - noise to use. One of these is called the *Laplace mechanism*.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "where $s$ is the *sensitivity* of $f$, and $\\textsf{Lap}(S)$ denotes sampling from the Laplace distribution with center 0 and scale $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *sensitivity* of a function $f$ is the amount $f$'s output changes when its input changes by 1. Sensitivity is a complex topic, and an integral part of designing differentially private algorithms;  For now, we will just point out that *counting queries* always have a sensitivity of 1: if a query counts the number of rows in the dataset with a particular property, and then we modify exactly one row of the dataset, then the query's output can change by at most 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we can achieve differential privacy for our example query by using the Laplace mechanism with sensitivity 1 and an $\\epsilon$ of our choosing. For now, let's pick $\\epsilon = 0.1$. We can sample from the Laplace distribution using Numpy's `random.laplace`."

Remember that sequential composition yields an *upper* bound on the total $\\epsilon$ of several releases, but this upper bound might not be tight. That's the case here - the actual privacy loss in this case appears to be somewhat lower than the upper bound $\\epsilon$ determined by sequential composition. Sequential composition is an extremely useful way to control total privacy cost, but keep in mind that the bound it provides is often quite loose."

    "## Parallel Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "The second important property of differential privacy is called *parallel composition*. Parallel composition can be seen as an alternative to sequential composition - a second way to calculate a bound on the total privacy cost of multiple data releases. Parallel composition is based on the idea of splitting your dataset into disjoint chunks and running a differentially private mechanism on each chunk separately. Since the chunks are disjoint, each individual's data appears in *exactly* one chunk - so even if there are $k$ chunks in total (and therefore $k$ runs of the mechanism), the mechanism runs exactly once on the data of each *individual*. Formally,\n",
    "\n",
    " - If $F(x)$ satisfies $\\epsilon$-differential privacy\n",
    " - And we split a dataset $X$ into $k$ disjoint chunks such that $x_1 \\cup ... \\cup x_k = X$\n",
    " - Then the mechanism which releases all of the results $F(x_1), ..., F(x_k)$ satisfies $\\epsilon$-differential privacy\n",
    " \n",
    "Note that this is a much better bound than sequential composition would give. Since we run $F$ $k$ times, sequential composition would say that this procedure satisfies $k\\epsilon$-differential privacy. Parallel composition allows us to say that the total privacy cost is just $\\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formal definition matches up with our intuition - if each participant in the dataset contributes one row to $X$, then this row will appear in *exactly* one of the chunks $x_1, ..., x_k$. That means $F$ will only \"see\" this participant's data *one time*, meaning a privacy cost of $\\epsilon$ is appropriate for that individual. Since this property holds for all individuals, the privacy cost is $\\epsilon$ for everyone."

    "Histograms are particularly interesting for differential privacy because they automatically satisfy parallel composition. Each \"bin\" in a histogram is defined by a possible value for a data attribute (for example, `'Education' == 'HS-grad'`). It's impossible for a single row to have *two* values for an attribute simultaneously, so defining the bins this way *guarantees* that they will be disjoint. Thus we have satisfied the requirements for parallel composition, and we can use a differentially private mechanism to release *all* of the bin counts with a total privacy cost of just $\\epsilon$."

    "The post-processing property means that it's always safe to perform arbitrary computations on the output of a differentially private mechanism - there's no danger of reversing the privacy protection the mechanism has provided. In particular, it's fine to perform post-processing that might reduce the noise or improve the signal in the mechanism's output (e.g. replacing negative results with zeros, for queries that shouldn't return negative results). In fact, many sophisticated differentially private algorithms make use of post-processing to reduce noise and improve the accuracy of their results.\n",

For example, the function $g$ might contain auxiliary information about elements of the dataset, and attempt to perform a linking attack using this information. The post-processing property says that such an attack is limited in its effectiveness by the privacy parameter $\\epsilon$, regardless of the auxiliary information contained in $g$."
